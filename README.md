## :hammer_and_wrench: Technologies / Libraries Used

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (for GUI)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (Python package installer)
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) (for testing)
- [pytest-mock](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock) (for mocking in tests)

## :rocket: Getting Started

To get started with the Cross Sum Number project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pedromst2000/Cross_Sum_Number_App.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Cross_Sum_Number_App
   ```

3. **Check Python Version**:
   Ensure you are using Python 3.x. You can check your Python version by running:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

4. **Upgrade pip**:
   It's a good practice to ensure that `pip` is up to date. You can upgrade it by running:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

5. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries for this project using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Application**:
   Launch the application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python crossSum.py
   ```

## :test_tube: Running Tests

To run the tests for the Cross Sum Number you can run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

or

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

or for unittest framework:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## :computer: Cross Sum Number Compiler

To compile the Cross Sum Number application into an executable, you can use `PyInstaller`. Follow these steps:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   If you haven't already installed PyInstaller, you can do so using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Compile the Application**:
   You can compile the application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller crossSum.py --name crossSum --windowed --onefile --noupx 
   --icon=assets/icon/icon.ico --add-data "assets/icon/icon.ico;assets/icon"
   ```
   This command will create a standalone executable in the `dist` directory. From there, you can run the application without needing to have Python installed on the target machine.


##  :link: Download Executable

In the following link you can download the Cross Sum Number executable:

https://github.com/pedromst2000/Cross_Sum_Number_App/releases/tag/v1.0.0

Within the release's **`Assets`** section, you will find a **`ZIP`** file **`crosssum-windows.zip`**
 containing the standalone executable. Simply download and extract it to run the application on your machineâ€”no need to install Python or any additional dependencies.
